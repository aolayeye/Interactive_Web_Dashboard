# UFOs
# Overview
This project is about using Javascript to create dynamic web content. We would focus on creating a dashboard that accepts user input and visually adjusts to reflect the user interaction. We would build the dynamic dashboard by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page. We would also draw on CSS and Bootstrap to build and style the HTML page and explore some chrome Dev tools to test code as the devlopment gets along.

We start by building a table to hold and display the UFO data from a JavaScript file, then add filters to the table which lets users refine their search on multiple levels. For location-based data for example a user could choose to view results located in certain countries or even cities. The table will be inserted into and visually displayed by an HTML page. We also includ an attention garbbing header, article summary, and brief article. In the end, we will have built a presentation that is both visually appealing and interactive
